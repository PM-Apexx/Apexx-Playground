    <h1>APEXX - Quickstart Guide</h1>
    <h2>eCommerce Payments Integration</h2>
    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>APEXX Payments APIs support a variety of payment options for merchants to integrate across multiple payment channels. This guide focuses predominantly on card payments, detailing different integration options and guiding you through authentication, updating transactions, and viewing them in the APEXX portal.</p>
    
    <h2>Integration Options</h2>
    <h3>Hosted (iFrame)</h3>
    <p>The APEXX Hosted iFrame allows merchants to process card payments without exposing their infrastructure to sensitive card data. The iFrame is embedded within the merchant's checkout and can be customized for a consistent look and feel. It supports handling authentication and authorization requests, returning the payment result to the merchant's specified return URL. This integration maintains the lowest level of PCI Compliance, SAQ A.</p>
    
    <h3>Client Side Encryption (CSE)</h3>
    <p>APEXX CSE enables merchants to process card payments using an APEXX JavaScript library hosted at the checkout. It generates an encrypted payload using specific data-apexx attributes in form elements, which is then submitted to APEXX for processing. The payment result is synchronously returned to the merchant. CSE allows for full page customization while maintaining a mid-level PCI Compliance, SAQ A-EP.</p>
    
    <h3>Direct Integration</h3>
    <p>With Direct Integration, merchants can process card payments via server-to-server requests post-checkout. The payment form, hosted on the merchant's website, sends payment data to APEXX for processing. This method offers the highest flexibility in presentation but requires the highest level of PCI Compliance, either SAQ D or PCI Level 1.</p>

    <h2>Sample Postman Collection</h2>
    <p>To support exploration of the APEXX Payments APIs, we provide a sample Postman collection. When you are ready to begin your integration, your APEXX Implementation contact will provide you with API credentials.</p>
    
    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <p><strong>Hosted (iFrame) Only</strong></p>
    <div class="important">
        <p>Begin the integration with customer data collection and a hosted payment request. Example request and response are shown below.</p>
        <pre class="code">{
    "organisation": "{{org_id}}",
    "currency": "GBP",
    "amount": 1000,
    "capture_now": false,
    ...
}</pre>
        <pre class="code">{
    "_id": "{{id}}",
    "url": "https://sandbox.apexx.global/atomic/v1/api/payment/checkout/{{id}}/page"
}</pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Customization</h2>
    <p>Customize the styling of the Hosted Payment Page (HPP) to match your checkout's look and feel.</p>
    <div class="code">/* Frame Style - Start */
@Frame-Font-Family: Poppins;
...
@Pay-Button-Font-Colour: #FFFFFF;
/* Frame Style - End */</div>

    <h2>Hosted Payment Flow</h2>
    <p>Steps for processing a hosted payment:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather customer details and send a hosted API request to APEXX.</li>
        <li>APEXX returns a response including the URL.</li>
        <li>Load the APEXX URL in an iFrame on your page to present the payment form.</li>
        <li>Customer enters payment details and clicks the Pay button.</li>
        <li>The customer authenticates the transaction as required.</li>
        <li>APEXX sends the payment request to the acquiring bank.</li>
        <li>The bank initiates a payment authorization request.</li>
        <li>Authorization response is returned to the acquirer.</li>
        <li>Payment response is returned to APEXX and then to the merchant.</li>
        <li>The merchant handles the data in the form of a POST request to the return URL.</li>
        <li>The merchant presents the transaction status to the customer.</li>
    </ol>
